#Browsr.JS
[Browsr](http://jsbin.com/ilegax) is a small javascript library (less than 1kb minified!) that detects browser name, version and engine, plus operating system and device type.
It's aimed for [the most popular platforms and browsers](http://gs.statcounter.com/), so don't expect to detect old and unknown browsers.

Inspired by [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/), Browsr also places classes on the <html> element and creates a Browsr object for javascript access (try typing "Browsr" on the console).

Right now, Browsr targets:

####Engines:
* Gecko
* Presto
* Trident
* Webkit

####Browsers:
* Chrome
* Internet Explorer
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari

####Operating Systems:
* Android
* iPad
* iPhone
* iOS
* Linux
* Mac OS
* Windows

####Devices (device type):
* Mobile (Android, iOS)
* Desktop (others)
